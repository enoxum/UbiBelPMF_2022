# Dagger

A fully-featured, modern game engine made for educational purposes.

## Features

- Dagger is data-driven and event-based.
- Dagger is extremely modular.
- Dagger is clear and clearly educational.

## Setting up the development environment

- [Windows](docs/setting_up_windows.md)
- [Linux](docs/setting_up_linux.md)
- Mac (WIP)

## Resources

Any kind of data used by engine that is not source code is considered a resource. Root directory for resources is `data\`
and so all references to resoruces begin there. For example, if you want to get a texture (from `data\textures`) you would
use `textures\mytexture.png` instead `data\textures\mytexture.png`.

## Rights and Reservations

Dagger is made as a part of Ubisoft Belgrade's game development course. All rights reserved.
